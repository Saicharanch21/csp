        <h1>Career Guidance</h1>
        <p>Career Guidance is a counselling program that helps students choose the right career path based on their educational and professional choices. A qualitative and quantitative assessment of the student's knowledge, skills, information, and experience identifies which career options are available.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There is a lack of awareness and information about the various career options available for students after passing out of school in India. There is no culture of visiting a career counsellor in India.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Recent surveys say that 93 percent of the students were aware of less than ten career options, mainly the basic ones like engineering, medicine, law, finance, IT, etc. In contrast, there are more than 600 career options available today. Therefore., the awareness levels of all the available career options for a student need to be increased.</p>
        <h3>Why Career Guidance is Important for Students</h3>
        <p>Educators in India are extensively working towards achieving improvements in the educational sector. Career counsellors are among those who groom younger minds in a suitable direction. When schools, institutes, or even parents lack to offer proper guidance to the students, career counsellors come into action. It is the utmost account of the counsellor to show and be aware of all the career paths available to the ones in need.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adhere broad perspective to explore career skills</li>
          <li>Gives a clear career road-map</li>
          <li>Makes an informed decision regarding the career progressions</li>
          <li>Gives the proper knowledge and approach to the prospects and trends of different career clusters</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Mistakes  students make while choosing their career after 10th</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Following the crowd/friends –</li><p> This is one of the most common mistakes which most of the students unknowingly make. Many students just take up any stream because their friends have decided to take that stream. This can turn out to be the worst decision of their lives. 

            It is necessary that you chose the stream which you are most passionate about rather than doing what most of the students are doing.</p>
            <li>Parental/Societal pressure –</li>
            <p>Let’s look at a common scenario.</p>

              <p>You: Dad, I want to take up Arts stream.</p>
              
              <p>Dad: There is no future in the Arts stream. You have to take up science. Look at Sharma Jis son. He had taken up science stream and he is doing very well in life.
              
              I am sure many students would have faced this situation. I am sure, that many parents would have given the examples of some Sharma or Gupta to influence the decision of their child. This can lead to a flawed career decision.</p>
              <li>Lack of knowledge -</li><p>There are a plethora of career options after 10th. If we go back 10-20 years ago, there were very fewer career options to choose from. But now the scenario is completely different. There are many career options available and with the help of proper career guidance and career counselling, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

        <p>State and central governments have set up Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) to impart training in various technical skills from different engineering and non-engineering sectors. 
          Since these courses help students secure jobs or become self-employed, they are known as vocational courses. 
          ITI courses are open to students of classes eight, 10 and 10+2. 
          The duration of the course can be one or two years.
